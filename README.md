# AUTHENTICATION API

This authentication api requires Redis be installed on the local system. If you are using
a redis installation on a different server please change the configuration in `config/initializers/redis.rb` to 
point to your redis instance.  This app is using the default Redis database, and 
is persisting all data to the redis instance once every second.
